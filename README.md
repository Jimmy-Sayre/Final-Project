# Final-Project

A webiste where a user can sign up with a username, add info about where they live and what instruments they play.

The users can then search for other users within the site to connect and set up a time to jam together.

I am creating this in hopes of making it easier for casual musicians to be able to play with others, or to help people start local bands.
